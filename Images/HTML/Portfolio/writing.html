        <h2>Example 1 : My First Two Weeks at CART</h2>
            <p>My first two weeks at CART have given me hope for the school year. One of the reasons I wanted to attend this school because it was kids who needed or wanted to learn in a different way and this school has honestly achieved that. <br> I came here with anxiety and fear, but was quickly shown that I fit into my class even if I don’t have an obsession with videogames. My class and I have a very similar sense of humor and I already made a friend, possibly for life, and I am on my way to making even more. <br> I was terrified in the class when I learned I was going to switch seats daily for a while. But every time we switched seats, I got more familiar with the different people I sat next to. And I love that in fact, telling jokes to my table mate, and asking for help comfortably. <br> The only for sure, good part of my day is coming to CART. I often find myself saying to myself “just a few more hours...just 30 minutes [until cart]” because this has become a safe space where I have little to no anxiety. <br> Also, I love my class. At first, I was unsure if I could keep up because I came in with no prior knowledge, but this class is so great. I don’t find programming work or a chore, I find it fun. And I think, that this class has shown me what I want to major in for college. <br> So, in conclusion, my first two weeks at CART have been great because I am attending a school with others kids who actually want to learn. I wish everyone could experience a system like CART that makes me feel way more prepared for school, college, and professionalism. </p>

        <h2>Example 2: My Story of Mental Illness</h2>
            <p>I like to think of my mental illness as a story. One with lots of blank pages and lots of full pages. Sometimes when I trust someone, I open this story, and show them. It's not a story I hide or am ashamed of. Life is too short be scared of mental illness. Here, is my story. </p>
            
            <p>Looking back, it all seems so long ago, like a cloud has passed over the memory. It was eigth grade. I was a naive, unknowing teenager, struggling with depression. Back then, I didn't know what it was, my feelings felt invalid due to my practically flawless upbringing. I struggled. Life was hard. It was a constant battle between "What's wrong with me?" and "I'm doing it for attention." The latter, of course, not being true as I was diagnosed with depression 3 years later. I felt as though I didn't fit in, as though something within me had changed and nobody except me had noticed. I was desperate to feel. I had turned to self harm. I'm not even sure why I started, all I know is that it felt... different. Like I had a secret purpose, a secret meaning.</p>
            
            <p>Over the course of three years, I had three suicide attempts. Yet no one noticed. I could have taken that secret to the grave. The first time, was by pills, as was the second. Each time I vomited the medications before they had their affect. The third time, was a few months ago, after I had been diagnosed and my parents were made aware of my battles. But I couldn't face the pain.I couldn't face myself and say, "I believe in a future. My life has purpose." Like many, I felt like a failure for not succeeding, but now, I think its a sign. Life will go on and I'm meant to be here.</p>
            
            <p>Depression is a battle. You can win, with medications and therapy, as well as family support, it's just finding your personal balance. Now, I'm on medications-proper ones, that are non-addictive-and I'm happier. That doesn't mean that I'm never sad, just that I have my bad days and good days. Sometimes I fall, sometimes I relapse and I break, but I rely on change. Change will guide you through the pages of life.</p>
            
            <p>Many people underestimate anxiety. It's seen as something similar to fear. But what I go through everyday is not the same as how I feel when I see a spider. Everyday, I'm terrified, anxious, nervous, constantly panicking. I found out just a few months ago, that it's called "social anxiety" or social phobia. Over the past year and a half, I have been struggling. I walk around campus with my head down, shoulders tucked in, not making eye contact and crossing my arms. In class, I don't raise my hand or speak to others. The only time I act like myself if when I'm with friends and feel comfortable. It's awful, being energetic and having live in an unrealistic fear.</p>
            
            <p>I have social phobia, or social anxiety disorder. As the name suggests, I am afraid of social     situations. I used to be afraid to hug my older brother, to ask my mom for things that I needed, to ask teachers for help. I couldn't-and still can't-accurately describe how it feels to anyone. It's a rushing of the heart, sweat forming on cold hands, a blush rising to the cheeks, and a fear that grew in my stomach. I was told, "It's okay, everyone gets nervous... You're just shy" and snarky comments on why I was scared. And that it everyday for me, a struggle of my outgoing personality, and my internal anxiety fostering panic attacks. I try to get through mental illness with self-reflection and thinking about my every thought and action and the ripple it causes, but thats anxiety and overthinking. I change the things I have control over, and learn slowly to accept the things I can't.</p> 
            
            <p>From December 2017 - February 2018, I hit the lowest of lows. I was hospitalized twice, about a month and a half apart. I was put on a 51-50, or a three day hold and was transfered to Sacremento to be put in a mental hospital or treatment center. It was the worst time of my life. Everything was stripped away from me. But the second time, I made friends and had intensive therapy. I stayed for five days. Overall, the toughest thing is figuring my meds out. I still have many bad days, and days I can't get out of bed, but I am a work in progress, ever changing and improving.

            <h2>Example 3 : Mood Disorder</h2>
            <h4>Major Depression</h4>
     					<p>Major depression is a persistant depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in daily life. Possible causes are biological, psychological, and social sources of distress. It most commonly, statistically, affects ages 14 and up. Symptoms range from hopelessness, to fatigue, to social withdrawal.</p>
						<p>Some copying skills for depression are sunlamps, a daily reflection process, simplifying your life, getting enough sleep, exercising and eating healthy, and make face-time a priority.</p>
            <h4>Dysthymia</h4>
						<p>Dysthymia is a lesser commonly known mood disorder that is defined as a persistent depressive disorder. It is a mild but long term form of depression, occuring for at least two years.</p>
					<h4>Bipolar Disorder (I, II, Cyclothymia, and Other Specified / Unspecified)</h4>
						<p>Bipolar disorder is an episode of moods swinging from depressive lows to manic highs. Bipolar disorder is caused by a combination of genetics, environment, and altered brain structure and chemistry. It most commonly occurs from ages 14 to 60. Treatment is lifelong as there is no cure. Advice for people who know someone with this is as follows: recovery is in the hands of the patient, reduce your own stress, find out if the person has a plan, and accept their highs and lows.</p>
