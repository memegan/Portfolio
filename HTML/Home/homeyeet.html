    <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Welcome visitors to my website! I hope you enjoy and are impressed with what you see and read.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Megan Gross and I am 16 years old. I currently attend Buchanan High School and CART (Center for Advanced Research and Technology) in Fresno, California. I have an interest in computer science, graphic design, and psychology. Computer science interests me because it is a subject that I find useful and intriging to learn about. Psychology sparks my interest due to my experiences and the fact that I am a strong advocate for mental illness.</p>
        <p>I have been in multiple honors and AP classes in school and always strive to do my best. For ten years I played soccer/competitive soccer which taught me time management and preperation. Currently I play badminton which teaches me how to be a leader and inspire others. I excell in logical based things but also have an aptitude for creativty and self-expression.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I draw, paint, journal, read poetry, listen to music, do DIY projects, make origami, chat with friends and family, take walks, go for long drives, scrapbook and watch Netflix. In certain situations, I am a confident individual with goals and creative ideas. I'm told I'm very resilient and insightful and I look forward to helping people by sharing my perspective.</p>
