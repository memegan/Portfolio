<h1>Web Projects</h1>
    <h2>Project : Zen Project</h2>
        <h3>Technology Skills : Brackets</h3>
            <p> <img src="/Images/CSSZengarden.PNG" alt="Zen Garden Image"></p>
            <p>In this project, Zen Garden, the class was given HTML code and had to redesign the webpage using CSS to our own style. I required much help with technicalities and spacing things to look nice, but once my teacher, Mr. Fast, helped me, the design was easy. Adding a box shadow, to the bottom and right corner of the boxes, was a nice touch and added class. I used the program Brackets to code this website and I practiced my design skills and how to code the design I want. I used the Habit of Mind, reflect to take a step back and view my website as a whole to see what worked and what I could improve upon.</p>
    <h2>Project : Mood Boards for Future Website</h2>
        <h3>Technology Skill : Photoshop</h3>
            <p> <img src="/Images/pastel%20mood%20board.PNG" alt="Pastel mood board"></p>
            <p>In the Mood Board project, the class worked independently to create a mood board for our class website. I chose a light pastel theme that was welcoming and gentle. I used photoshop and my visual eye for aesthetics to bring together pictures and colors that would be a softer side and not harsh to the eye. Even though, in the end, my class of mostly boys vetoed the idea, I was still proud of myself for coming up with a good theme. I used the skill, Collaboration, to work with others even when things didn’t go my way. I stayed calm and collected and helped the class decide on a professional them. </p>
    <h2>Project : Endangered Animals/Cause</h2>
        <h3>Project : Endangered Animals/Cause</h3>
        <p><img src="/Images/MnetalHelathfinal.PNG" alt="">
        <img src="/Images/MenatalHeathcode.PNG" alt=""></p>
        <p>On the Endangered Species/Causes project, I worked with my partner, Yasmine Romero, to code and design a seven page website on Mental Illness and Developmental Disorders. We directly address the stigma surrounding mental health, as well as give general descriptions of these disorders. Also, as you can see on the finished page, we included buttons with links to volunteer, or get more help. We also included a side article of helplines to call or text if someone was in need. Having first hand experienced mental illness ourselves, it was quite easy to throw ourselves into this project and devote countless hours to get it right. This project had a lot to do with collaboration as we had to split up work and sell the other one on our ideas. The hardest part, was listening to one another; we were two stubborn people with much creativity and skill. But when we did listen to one another, the outcome was amazing. For example, last minute we changed the background because the last one didn’t fit. When I looked at the old one, it didn’t quite fit, but since it was last minute it was difficult to make last minute changes but I’m glad we did. This project taught me many things and will help me in the future to work with others.
