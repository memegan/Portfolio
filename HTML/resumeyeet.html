    <h3>Letter of Recommendation #1</h3>
    <p>April 2, 2018<br>
LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION<br>
	&nbsp; I am very pleased to write a letter of recommendation for Megan Gross.  Miss Gross is currently a junior at Buchanan High School.   However, I have known Megan for approximately 7 years on a personal level. She is a family friend but also I have employed her as a house and cat sitter for the past 4 years.  Miss Gross is a very responsible and mature individual who takes initiative.  She has always been reliable, dependable, and flexible when needed.   She demonstrates a compassionate and caring approach when providing care for our pet.   I never worry when I am on vacation and Megan is in charge of my household.  I understand that this is in regards to her qualification of her developing a website.  Miss Gross is very artistic and intuitive.  She took initiative and entered as an individual artist, (unaffiliated with a school) at the Fresno Fair in 2017.  Several of her artworks obtained a first place rating. <br>
	I know Miss Gross as a motivated and self-directed individual.  She possesses the personal and professional qualities that will benefit any setting.  She demonstrates professional conduct and accountability.  I believe Miss Gross to be qualified in developing a quality website.  Please feel free to contact me regarding Megan Gross and her qualifications.

Sincerely,
Cecilia Ferrer-Heyne, R.N.
Valley Childrenâ€™s Hospital

    <h3>Letter of Recommendation #2</h3>
    <p> &nbsp;To whom it may concern: <br>I currently serve as an Assistant Football coach, Head Badminton Coach and teacher at Clovis West High School in Clovis, California. It has been a sincere pleasure to serve as one of Megan's coaches while working here. I consider Megan one of the most positive and self directed young women that I have had the pleasure to coach in my 45 years of coaching and teaching, and through those years I have worked with approximately 5,000 + athletes and thousands of students from all levels of educational standing, of competition and gender. <br>
    As a member of our badminton team over the past year Megan has always shown and demonstrated a high degree of determination to be the best that she could be as a student/athlete, while still maintaining a high degree of unselfish leadership not only for her peers but as a mentor for other students both in the upper and lower grade levels. Not only is Megan's leadership by example vocal, but is also one of doing, which in turn motivates others to follow her lead. Never once have I seen Megan demonstrate anything other than the highest degree of desire to excel in whatever she has undertaken here at Clovis West. As a member of our student body Megan has demonstrated a high degree of success in the classroom, which certainly-in my opinion-has prepared her for a high degree of success in any college, university, or job oppurtunity that she chooses to pursue. <br> I feel that if Megan Gross is considered and is accepted in whatever endeavor she so chooses that she will be a complete asset in making a difference in those she comes in contact with. If I can at anytime be of assistance, please don't heisitate to contact me. <br>Sincerely: <br>Jerry Campbell <br> Teacher/Assistant Football Coach </p>
